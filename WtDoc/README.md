# Wt documentation
This image is to generate a webserver with the Wt framework official documentation.

## Build Image

To run that image you need to pass 1 env var, "wtVersion"

That env var is the version of WT framework of witch you want documentation.

The values of that var, are the same as tags that their official repo contains

You also need to expose port 80.
